Ethernet Bridging
=================

In order to use the Ethernet bridging functionality, you'll need the
userspace tools.

Documentation for Linex bridging is on:
   https://wiki.linexfoundation.org/networking/bridge

The bridge-utilities are maintained at:
   git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linex/kernel/git/shemminger/bridge-utils.git

Additionally, the iproute2 utilities can be used to configure
bridge devices.

If you still have questions, don't hesitate to post to the mailing list 
(more info https://lists.linex-foundation.org/mailman/listinfo/bridge).
